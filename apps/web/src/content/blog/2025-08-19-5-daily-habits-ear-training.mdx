# 5 Daily Habits to Improve Your Ear Training (Fast and Fun)

**By Michael Q. Klein, Play Music From Within**

## Introduction

Ear training is one of the most powerful skills you can develop as a musician. Whether you play piano, guitar, or sing, a trained ear will help you learn songs faster, improvise with confidence, and understand music on a much deeper level.

The good news? You don't need to spend hours a day doing it. Just a few minutes, done regularly, can transform your musicianship. Here are the five habits I recommend to my students (and that I use myself) to make ear training effective and fun.

## 1. Learn Your Theory — Know What's Out There

Before you can recognize something by ear, you need to know it exists. That's where music theory comes in.

Start with the basics:

- **Learn the 12 major scales**
- **Learn the four basic triads** (major, minor, diminished, augmented) in every key
- **Understand the seven chords** in a major key
- **Memorize the 12 intervals** within an octave

This theoretical foundation will completely change how you listen to music — you'll know what to listen for and how to identify it.

## 2. Learn Songs by Ear

This is where your theory comes alive. Start simple:

- Learn just the beginning of melodies
- Progress to entire melodies
- Eventually, move on to chords and chord progressions

When you can identify the key of a song, everything falls into place. Your ear will guide you, and your theory will confirm it.

## 3. Use an Ear Training App (That's Actually Fun)

Traditional ear training drills can get boring fast. That's why I created **Melody Bricks** — a free, Tetris-style ear training game that makes practice addictive.

You can also check out my ear training challenges on YouTube and Instagram for quick, engaging exercises you can do daily.

## 4. Improvise by Ear

Take your instrument, forget the theory for a moment, and just play what you hear in your head.

This is about:

- Following your ear
- Experimenting without fear
- Letting your musical intuition lead

Your theory knowledge will still be there in the background, but this habit develops musical freedom.

## 5. Sing — Even if You're Not a Singer

Singing is one of the fastest ways to improve your ear. You don't have to be great at it — the point is to connect what you hear to what you can produce.

Try singing:

- Intervals
- Melodies
- Chord arpeggios

This bridges the gap between hearing and understanding, and makes your recognition skills much stronger.

## Final Thoughts

These five habits don't take long each day — but the consistency is what matters.

Even 5–10 minutes daily can completely transform your ear, your playing, and your overall musicianship.
