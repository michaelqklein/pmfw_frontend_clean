This folder contains all blog posts in MDX format.

## How to add a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.mdx`
2. Add frontmatter at the top of the file:
   ```mdx

   description: "A brief description for SEO"
   date: "2024-01-15"
   author: "Your Name"
   tags: ["music", "education", "intervals"]
   ---
   ```
3. Write your content in Markdown below the frontmatter
4. The post will automatically appear on the blog listing page

## Example:
```mdx
